## How to Use Queues in Web Applications

### Node.js and Redis Tutorial (Bull Library)

 We'll build a simple project using Node.js and Redis. We'll use the Bull library as it simplifies a lot of the complexities involved in building a queue system. The project will have a single endpoint to send emails.

- Usage of Bull library: https://www.npmjs.com/package/bull
- Both Javascript and Typescript variants of the code (see also package.json)
